# Alba amicorum of the KB

We are currently collecting data of the alba amicorum of the KB and structuring them on wikidata. We have three main sources we collect these data from: the KB catalogue, our LOD platform data.bibliotheken.nl and Europeana. 

The initial pilot project is the data and images from the Album amicorum Jacob Heyblocq that currently [has its own repository](https://github.com/KBNLwikimedia/AlbumAmicorumJacobHeyblocq). 

In the second phase we collect data and images from ten alba amicorum: general scripts, workflows and manuals are shared in this repository.
